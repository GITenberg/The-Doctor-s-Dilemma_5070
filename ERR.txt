Title: The Doctor's Dilemma
Author: George Bernard Shaw
Release Date: March 26, 2009 [EBook #5070]
Last Updated: December 10, 2012

Hi, David,

Here’s yet another Shaw play with changes. As before, I’ve used my hardbound copy of Bernard Shaw Complete Plays with Prefaces, Dodd, Mead, New York, 1963, this time Vol. I, page numbers given below.

One issue is formatting. When more than one person is speaking at once, braces are used as needed for the speech. The formatting of the braces and the speeches, however, doesn’t currently work, because all the speakers are on the same continuing line(s). I could try reformatting to at least put each speaker on a separate line. I’ll give a couple examples at the end of the list of corrections, so you can let me know if you’d like me to try reformatting. Unfortunately, the reformatting works best with a fixed-width font--but even with the variable-width fonts, it would be more readable.

Thank you!

Jo-Anne
